# VXcode Theme for VSCode

## A sleek, Xcode-inspired theme for Visual Studio Code

VXcode is a soothing theme that draws inspiration from the aesthetics and color palette of Apple's Xcode. Carefully crafted to make syntax highlighting feel intuitive and easy to read, especially on TS/JS projects, but it should look good in other languages too.
